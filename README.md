# python-api-challenge

### Code Sources:
- Classwork from Modules 4-6 were used as reference in generating all the code in this challenge.
- XPert Learning Assistant was used to double-check my code for any errors.
- For ***Step 5*** of [VacationPy.ipynb](Starter_Code/VacationPy.ipynb), adding the hotel names upon hovering over the city was done through the assistance of XPert Learning Assistance.

> [!NOTE]
> In [VacationPy.ipynb](Starter_Code/VacationPy.ipynb), I did not exactly match the criteria for narrowing down the cities. Reason being is, I wanted to include more cities (i.e. plot points) for the map I would generate in the last output cell.
